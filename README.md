I built and ran this website between 2000 and 2001. It was listed by MTV's now defunct MusicNewswire as one of the then nascent web's top twenty sources, alongside Billboard and VH1. The most exciting part of it — for a 13/14-year-old excited by new music — was receiving scores of pre-release CDs from record companies. The entire project was written in PHP linking to a MySQL database, with HTML as well as a little CSS and JavaScript for the frontend; I'm still proud of the code (less the writing!).
