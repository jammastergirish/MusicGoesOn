==================================

  A set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the WWW.
  -----------------------------------------

Announcement
------------

   After 5 months, 5 beta releases and 4 release candidate versions,
   the phpMyAdmin developers are pleased to announce the availability
   of phpMyAdmin 2.2.0.

   phpMyAdmin is intended to handle the administration of MySQL over
   the Web. The project was started by Tobias Ratschiller in 1998,
   and is now one of the most popular PHP script used worldwide.

   (Un)fortunately, Tobias then stopped to work on phpMyAdmin last
   year: the last version (2.1.0) was released on 6. August 2000. In
   the mean time, there were many suggestions and good ideas around,
   as well as a security advisory. 

   That is why on 31st March 2001, Olivier Müller (Switzerland),
   supported by Marc Delisle (Québec), Loïc Chapeaux (France) and a
   team of 8 other developers re-started the phpmyadmin project on
   SourceForge.net, with the authorization of the original package
   maintainer. And now, after 5 months of patches, bugfixes, new
   features and testing, the version 2.2.0 is finally ready.

   Available at http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net, it includes the
   following highlights:


Highlights
----------

     * Security fixes
     * New languages: Thai, Swedish, Galician, Romanian, Slovak, 
       Japanese, Korean
     * Dynamic multiple language support, with automatic browser 
       language detection
     * Improved documentation
     * Better file import/export possibilities
     * PEAR, CSS2 and XHTML 1.0 compliant (as far as possible)
     * User and Database administration page
     * Gzip and HTTP compression support
     * Removed necessity of magic_quotes_gpc (autodetection)
     * Bookmarks (sql queries) feature
     * Database usage statistics
     * Javascript compatibility improvements
     * Table maintenance features (repair, check, optimize)
     * Maintained PHP3 compatibility
     * Better BLOB support
     * Table usage and row statistics
     * Multiple table types
     * Now backed by a full-time development team! :)

    binary data

    than 14 fields (check the FAQ)
