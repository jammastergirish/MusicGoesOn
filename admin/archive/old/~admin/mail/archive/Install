Installing PHPMailApp

1. Ungzip and untar PHPMailApp.
	$ tar -xzvf PHPMailApp-x.xx.tar.gz
	where x.xx is the version number of PHPMailApp that you downloaded.
2. Edit login.php.  The cookies that are set need to reflect the settings of the site you are using to host PHPMailApp.  The first 6 lines of that file you need to change overdoseinc.sourceforge.net to the url of the site you are using to host PHPMailApp and the /PHPMailApp/ path needs to be changed to the path PHPMailApp will be located on your site.  Note.. The path needs to be the path relative to how a browser acceses the site, not the actual path on that machine that PHPMailApp is located.  ie. if you extracted PHPMailApp to /www/htdocs/PHPMailApp then the path you put in login.php would be simply /PHPMailApp/ not /www/htdocs/PHPMailApp/.
3. Type the url www.yoursite.com/PHPMailApp into your browser and give it a test run.
4. Report any bugs found to me (transistor@users.sourceforge.net)
5. Enjoy.
