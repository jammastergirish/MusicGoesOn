PHPMailApp
This application is going to be progressing as quickly as i can make it.  If you have any suggestions, questions, bugs to report please feel free to email me at transistor@users.sourceforge.net
As of September 02, 2000 PHPMailApp now uses class.POP3.php3 which can be found at http://www.thewebmasters.net/php/.
Also, Sourceforge transfered over to PHP4.  So if any oddities are found by users on sytems with PHP3 please let me know so i can fix them.

Thanks and more will be coming soon, including more documentation.
