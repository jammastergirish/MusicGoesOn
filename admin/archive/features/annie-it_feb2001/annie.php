<b>Annie Nightingale</b>�s controversial and innovative new internet only chat show <i>ANNIE@IT</i>
will hit your monitors on Monday February 5th. The seminal DJ and broadcaster who has just
been awarded an MBE in the New Years Honours list will be presenting the show that will be
broadcast on Mondays and Fridays at 12.30 pm (lunchtime, folks) on
<a href="/redir.php?url=http://www.annieatit.com/" target="_blank">www.annieatit.com</a><br><br>

Here's how Annie describes her new show:
<i>"I think my life has always been about communication and music and enthusiasm.  The internet,
and NetBeat especially, seems to be offering a chance to do a visual and musical show that
will be free.  Free of charge (!), free of censorship, free in its conversation, free to let
my guests say what they want without the sort of editing that goes on in terrestrial
broadcasting.  TV on <i>The Box</i>  has really lost its drive and enthusiasm - reality gameshows
are surely not what TV was invented for.  I�m always excited by the innovative and what may be
risk-taking.  Let�s see what happens..."</i><br><br>
